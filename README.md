# NYC Citi Bike Challenge

## Overview
In New York City, there is a service to rent bicycles to get around the city.  Our analysis was done to examine various factors, including what gender utilizes the service more, how long most people use the bikes, what the most popular starting stations and ending stations are, et al.  Looking at the statistics for August of 2019, we saw that there were 2,344,224 trips on bikes through this bike service.  Below are some results of the analysis done on this data.

## Results
The results of the analysis was interesting, but not very surprising.  

Almost all trips were less than an hour long with the bulk of those trips lasting less than 10 minutes.  Additionally, the time frame for the majority of trips were Monday through Friday between 7am and 10am.  That would indicate that a lot of people ride a bike to work. Also typically, the younger a rider is, the longer their average trip lasts.

When looking at rider population, approximately 2/3 of all riders are male, with female taking about 25%.  The rest are unidentified.  

Another area of interest would be bike utilization that would help determine the bike that is used most often and therefore, would need repairs more quickly.  Bike utilization is based on the total trip duration for each bike while repairs are based on the number of trips, regardless of the bike's total trip durations.

## Summary
It appears men are the largest number of riders for this service and that the overwhelming majority of the riders are also monthly subscribers.  Also, the time of day seems consistent with those that work nine to five.  According to the heatmaps, the heaviest use is between 6am & 10am and between 5pm & 7pm, Monday through Friday.
